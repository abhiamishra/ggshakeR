Welcome to ggshakeR!

This is R's all-inclusive package for visualization and analysis of openly available soccer data.

This package aims to provide people interested in football analysis and visualization a platform to learn about it while also learning a new language while at it. This package is designed to work with open soccer data. These data sets, for now, include:

* [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/)
* [StatsBomb Open Dataset](https://github.com/statsbomb/StatsBombR)
* [Understat](https://understat.com/)

R gets a bad rep, at times, especially compared to it's more cooler brother, Python. However, as you'll find with ggshakeR, it really isn't that bad!

Let's get you started with the package!

# Getting Started With ggshakeR

First things first, install R and RStudio. R is the actual language while RStudio is the IDE that will help you work with language in a nice way.

Here are links to download both:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

OK, now how do you get ggshakeR into RStudio? 

First install the devtools package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

After that, write the actual code to install ggshakeR:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("abhiamishra/ggshakeR", subdir="ggshakeR")
```

Now the library is installed but it's not in your session just yet! When a package is in a session means you can actually use the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(gghshakeR)
```

And that's it you're done!

We hope you have fun!
